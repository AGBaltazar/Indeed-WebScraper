# Indeed-WebScraper
By using NodeJS this web scraper will search through Indeed and find the Junior Developer positions available and then send them through email.

This scraper is able to get the title and company name from a job posting using cheerio followed up with nodemailer to assit with the emailing. 

TO COME(Hopefully) :                                                                                                                                               

  While this is a work in progress, I hope to use node-cron to schedule daily emails of the daily postings.
  Since you can't really do much with the title and company; I hope to include a link to the job posting for each email.
  Scraping LinkedIn job board to get roughly the same curated list.
